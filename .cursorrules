# ECG: Explanation-Consistency Graphs

## Context
- This is a research project targeting ACL 2026 Theme Track: Explainability
- Deadline: January 5, 2026 (ARR submission)
- Core contribution: Graph-aggregated LLM explanations for training data debugging

## Project Structure
- instruction/ → Research methodology, proposals, literature
- docs/ → Implementation documentation (numerically ordered)
- src/ecg/ → Core implementation
- configs/ → YAML configurations
- scripts/ → Experiment runners
- outputs/ → Results, checkpoints, explanations
- references/ → Cloned baseline repos (not committed)

## Documentation
- Keep docs/ files numerically ordered (00_, 01_, 02_, etc.)
- Update docs/00_index.md when adding new docs
- Log all sessions in docs/03_session_log.md

## Training Commands
- DO NOT automatically run training commands
- Only provide commands for the user to run manually
- User will execute training when ready

## Key Dependencies
- vLLM for LLM inference (requires GPU)
- FAISS for fast kNN graphs
- Cleanlab as primary baseline
- sentence-transformers for embeddings

## Code Style
- Use type hints
- Include docstrings
- Follow existing patterns in src/ecg/
- Keep functions focused and testable

## Key Paths
- Model outputs: outputs/checkpoints/
- Explanations: outputs/explanations/
- Results: outputs/results/
- Config: configs/default.yaml

## Paper
- LaTeX source will go in paper/
- Follow ACL 2026 style guide
- Keep bibliography updated with instruction/literature.md

## Methodology Reference
- See instruction/playbook-00-research-sprint/ for speedrun methodology
- See instruction/research_proposal_1.md for detailed ECG methodology
- See instruction/literature.md for 103-paper bibliography
