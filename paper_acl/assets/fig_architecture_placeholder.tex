\caption{\textbf{ECG Pipeline.} Given training data with potentially noisy labels, ECG: (1) generates structured LLM explanations; (2) embeds the explanation text; (3) constructs a kNN graph in explanation space; (4) computes neighborhood surprise---the negative log-probability of each label given its neighbors. The key insight: the same kNN algorithm achieves \textbf{0.832 AUROC} on explanation embeddings vs.\ 0.671 on input embeddings (+24\%), while Cleanlab fails completely (0.107) on artifact-aligned noise.}
