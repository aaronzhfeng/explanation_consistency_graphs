# Pre-Implementation Checklist

> Verify before writing any code

---

## 1. Project Plan Approved

- [ ] Title and framing finalized
- [ ] Novelty clearly articulated
- [ ] Scope is realistic for timeline
- [ ] Backup plans exist

## 2. Resources Confirmed

- [ ] Compute access verified
- [ ] Datasets available (or know how to get them)
- [ ] Required libraries/tools identified
- [ ] No blocking dependencies

## 3. Technical Design Ready

- [ ] Architecture diagram drawn
- [ ] Key algorithms specified
- [ ] Data format defined
- [ ] APIs sketched

## 4. Environment Setup

- [ ] Repository initialized
- [ ] `.gitignore` configured
- [ ] Virtual environment created
- [ ] Dependencies installed
- [ ] GPU drivers working

## 5. Data Acquired

- [ ] All datasets downloaded
- [ ] Data format understood
- [ ] Sample data inspected manually
- [ ] Train/val/test splits defined

## 6. Baseline Clarity

- [ ] Know what baselines to compare against
- [ ] Have implementations or know how to get them
- [ ] Metrics defined

---

## Red Flags — Stop If:

- [ ] Can't clearly explain what's novel
- [ ] Don't have access to required data
- [ ] Compute is insufficient for planned experiments
- [ ] Timeline is <50% of realistic estimate
- [ ] No one has done anything similar (too novel = risky)
