## Venue Selection Criteria

### 1. Topic Fit

| Question | Red Flag | Green Flag |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Does my work fit the CFP? | Tangential connection | Directly mentioned |
| Is this a hot topic? | Cold/dying area | Growing interest |
| Are similar papers published here? | No precedent | Clear fit |

### 2. Timeline Fit

| Factor | Check |
|--------|-------|
| Days until deadline | Enough for full pipeline? |
| Review timeline | When will you hear back? |
| Camera-ready deadline | Enough time to revise? |
| Resubmission options | If rejected, where next? |

### 3. Format Fit

| Paper Type | Typical Length | Best For |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| Full paper | 8-10 pages | Complete systems |
| Short paper | 4-6 pages | Focused contributions |
| Workshop paper | 4-8 pages | Early ideas, niche topics |
| Extended abstract | 2-4 pages | Preliminary results |

## Good Venues for Speedruns

### Workshop Papers (Recommended)

**Why workshops are ideal:**
- 40-60% acceptance rates
- Shorter papers (4-8 pages)
- Focused topics (easier to fit)
- Faster review cycles
- Often co-located with major conferences

**Where to find workshops:**
- NeurIPS Workshops: neurips.cc/Workshops
- ICML Workshops: icml.cc/Workshops
- AAAI Workshops: aaai.org/Conference/
- ACL Workshops: aclanthology.org

### Example Good Fit: AAAI Bridge Workshops

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| 8 pages + refs + appendix | Smaller audience than main |
| Single-blind review | Less prestige |
| ~50% acceptance | — |
| Fast turnaround | — |

## Venue Red Flags

| Red Flag | Why Bad |
|----------|---------|
| "We've never published ML here" | Review quality unknown |

## Backup Venue Strategy

Always have a backup plan:

```
Primary: [WORKSHOP X]
  ↓ (if rejected)
Backup 1: [SIMILAR WORKSHOP Y]
  ↓ (if rejected)  
Backup 2: [ARXIV + RESUBMIT]
  ↓ (if still want to publish)
Backup 3: [NEXT YEAR'S CONFERENCE]
```
