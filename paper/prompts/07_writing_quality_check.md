## Checklist to Evaluate

### 1. Clarity

- [ ] **Technical terms defined**: Are key concepts explained when first introduced?
- [ ] **Sentence structure**: Are sentences easy to parse? No garden-path sentences?
- [ ] **Ambiguous pronouns**: Is it always clear what "it", "this", "they" refer to?
- [ ] **Jargon balance**: Accessible to NLP audience without over-explaining basics?
- [ ] **Notation consistency**: Are variables/symbols used consistently throughout?

### 2. Flow and Organization

- [ ] **Logical progression**: Does each paragraph follow naturally from the previous?
- [ ] **Section transitions**: Are there clear bridges between sections?
- [ ] **Topic sentences**: Does each paragraph have a clear main point?
- [ ] **Forward/backward references**: Do "as we show in §X" and "as mentioned in §Y" help navigation?
- [ ] **Parallel structure**: Are lists and comparisons structured consistently?

### 3. Conciseness

- [ ] **Redundancy**: Are there repeated points or phrases?
- [ ] **Wordy constructions**: "in order to" → "to", "the fact that" → omit, etc.
- [ ] **Unnecessary hedging**: Excessive "may", "might", "perhaps", "somewhat"?
- [ ] **Filler phrases**: "It is important to note that", "It should be mentioned that"
